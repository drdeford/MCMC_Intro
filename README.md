# MCMC_Intro
Friendly and interactive introduction to discrete MCMC

(Under Development!)
These Sage interact programs accompany my notes introducing discrete MCMC to non-mathematical audiences. Currently, you can run these programs by copying the code into my Sage cell terminal <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/sage_cell.html">here</a>.

Currently, there are functions for estimating distributions and expected values of die rolls with arbitrary faces and drawing Scrabble tiles with replacement. There is also an animation for a random walk on the keys of a computer keyboard.
