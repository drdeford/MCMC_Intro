# MCMC_Intro (Under Development!)

Friendly and interactive introduction to discrete MCMC

These Sage interact programs accompany my notes introducing discrete MCMC to non-mathematical audiences. Polished versions of these are organized <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/mcmc_intro.php">here</a> with some additional details. 

You can run the versions here by copying the code into my Sage cell terminal <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/sage_cell.html">here</a>.
